Final Doc
This week I wasn't able to get much done again because of my two capstone projects. 
The good news is we got the VR one done already, so here forth ice fishing becomes my #1 project.

What I got done:
- Start Menu
- Finished Full game loop with no bugs, at least 2 rounds of new content
- fixed stack overflow and other annoying bugs
- adding particle effects as a way of telling the user they caught a fish

Things I wish I could have got done:
- Implementing upgrades
- Adding more wave randomization and difficulty
- no spawn overlaps
- making upgrades work
- more visually pleasing
- pause menu

I accrued some technical debt for sure by crunching at the last minute on this. 
When I started, I wanted to experiment with delegates and singletons, but that 
in my opinion was a big mistake. I got carried away with singletons and made 3
huge ones. Now my code is all over the place, and I have a UI manager starting rounds.

It's not the worst place to be in, but the seperation of concerns there is just nasty. 
The delegates don't make it any better, because who knows who's listening to them.

Singletons and delegates aren't very common in Unity, and through this project I found out why.
I could have implemented a lot more things that I wanted to, but because of messy code and glaring bugs thanks to
singletons and delegates, that was sidetracked.
