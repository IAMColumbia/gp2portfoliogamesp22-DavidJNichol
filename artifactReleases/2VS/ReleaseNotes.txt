Release Notes version 2 Vertical Slice

This edition, the first order of importance was changing the way the hook and line moved with mouse input.
I changed it from a system of having the hook follow the mouse, to apply a movement with a speed to the hook
based on whether the mouse was going up or down. This was important because now the hook doesn't go slower/faster
based on screen size, the only mouse input info it needs is up or down.

There was a problem I encountered after this where I had to choose to put a rigidbody on the hook and move it on 
FixedUpdate(), or put it on all the fish and have them move on FixedUpdate(). I chose to put the hook on FixedUpdate
not only since it would be more performant, but because it felt a lot more clunky with the fish moving with a jitter.
The hook moves fast enough to the point where it's hard to notice.

I decided I should just get all the art out of the way with one big swoop, and so I spent some time making all the pixel assets
this week. 

I added a basic shop with a few upgrades that you can hover and see information about. I plan on using the decorator pattern
once I add functionality to those items. 

I added a goal and a timer to each round to add some challenge. When the timer is up, the player is judged whether or not they
meet the criteria for number of fish caught. If not, they lose. I haven't implemeneted the lose state yet however.

I added a new fish, Nemo and a new obstacle, the Can. 

I started a WaveManager and Wave system so that difficulty can increase and or be randomized per wave, this has yet to be finished.

I decided to use a wavemanager who has a list of waves, where waves are a wrapper for modifying the spawned elements to change difficulty,
randomness and funness. The wave has methods like SetSpeed(MarineObject obj, float speed), where you can change the spawned objects of that
wave to your liking.
