Release Notes version 3 Final

This build I added:
Upgrade, modded reel, titanum hook, time pebble classes
support for wave difficulty including spawn probability per marine object

This sprint I really didn't do a whole lot, since I've been sick and capstone has been kicking my butt. 
I got really caught up on the spawn probabilities since that's a big part of the game, but it also turned out to be one of the most 
difficult. 

I realised using 3 public static singletons was not a good idea. Many times classes would now depend on execution order
as I would set variables of the singletons in a start method, then another start method would throw null because it came 
before that in order. Not good.

then I have the problem of crashing whenever the game is over due to stack overflow. I ran out of time basically by the time 
I got that error.

Lot's more to do!
